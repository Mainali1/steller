You are given 5 purified water bottles when you land in the planet. You can also drink water from the water sources in the planet although they might have bad effect on you. You can collect water from any water source in this planet but almost all are unpurified and arent suitable for drinking. It can be purified by boiling the water. You can also buy water from the sattelite incase you have no water."
